# Introduction
I have successfully concluded a comprehensive data cleaning project centered around Nashville Housing data. This project served as a significant assessment of my ability to utilize SQL for the purpose of cleaning raw data, ultimately transforming it into a refined format.

# Tool Used
MS SQL - SQL Server Management Studio

# Dataset
The dataset on Covid-19, obtained from [Here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), onsists of 70 columns and 358,802 rows, covering the timeline from February 26, 2020, to November 22, 2023. To enhance analysis capabilities, the Covid-19 dataset was split into two distinct tables: Covid Deaths ([Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Covid%20Death.xlsb)) and Covid Vaccinations ([Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Covid%20Vaccinations.xlsb)). This split facilitates the application of the JOIN function, streamlining the exploration and understanding of the data.

# Data cleaning and transformation
The data cleaning and transformation were carried out using MS SQL. The following actions were taken to enhance the quality and structure of the data.

(1) Total Cases vs Total Deaths.
(2) Top 10 Countries with the highest death rate.
(3) Month with the highest Covid Deaths in United Kingdom.
(4) Total Cases vs Population. Shows the % of population that got Covid (Covid_Infection_Rate).
(5) Top 10 countries with Highest Covid infection rate compared to the population.
(6) Top 10 Countries with the Highest death count and percentage per population. 
(7) Top 10 Countries with the Highest death count
(8) Continent with the highest death count per population
(9) Total Population vs Vaccinations. Shows percentage of population that has received at least one covid vaccine.
(10) Global Numbers

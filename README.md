# Introduction
I have successfully concluded a comprehensive data cleaning project centered around Nashville Housing data. This project served as a significant assessment of my ability to utilize SQL for the purpose of cleaning raw data, ultimately transforming it into a refined format.

# Tool Used
MS SQL - SQL Server Management Studio

# Dataset
The Covid-19 dataset, sourced from [Here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), comprises 70 columns and 358,802 rows. This dataset was subsequently split into two tables: Covid Deaths ([Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Covid%20Death.xlsb)) and Covid Vaccinations ([Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Covid%20Vaccinations.xlsb)). The rationale behind this division is to facilitate the utilization of the JOIN function in data analysis.

Data cleaning and transformation
The data cleaning and transformation were carried out using MSSQL. The following actions were taken to enhance the quality and structure of the data.

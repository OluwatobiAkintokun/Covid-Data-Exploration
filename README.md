# Introduction
I have successfully concluded a comprehensive data cleaning project centered around Nashville Housing data. This project served as a significant assessment of my ability to utilize SQL for the purpose of cleaning raw data, ultimately transforming it into a refined format.

# Tool Used
MS SQL - SQL Server Management Studio

# Dataset
The dataset on Covid-19, obtained from [Here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), consists of 70 columns and 358,802 rows, covering the timeline from February 26, 2020, to November 22, 2023. To enhance analysis capabilities, the Covid-19 dataset was split into two distinct tables: Covid Deaths ([Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Covid%20Death.xlsb)) and Covid Vaccinations ([Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Covid%20Vaccinations.xlsb)). This split facilitates the application of the JOIN function, streamlining the exploration and understanding of the data.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Through the utilization of SQL, I unconvered the following.

(1) Total Cases vs Total Deaths in United Kingdom.
